    Revolut is a British financial technology company that offers banking services, but as of December 2022 does not have a UK banking licence. Headquartered in London, it was founded in 2015 by Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko. It offers accounts featuring currency exchange, debit cards, virtual cards, Apple Pay, interest-bearing "vaults", commission-free stock trading, crypto, commodities, and other services.

Revolut has expanded into new markets such as Japan and expanded staff from 1500 to around 5000. In November 2020 it was breaking even and, with a Â£4.2 billion valuation became the UK's most valuable fintech company. In January 2021 Revolut applied for a UK banking licence, but as of December 2022 the outcome was still awaited.[5] A US$800 million funding round in July 2021 brought the company's valuation to US$33 billion, making it the most valuable UK tech startup at the time.[6][7][8]

Since Revolut does not have UK bank status, it does not reimburse victims of authorized push payment fraud.
